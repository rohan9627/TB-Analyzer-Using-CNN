# TB-Analyzer-Using-CNN
This is an ongoing deep learning project that aims to detect tuberculosis from chest X-ray images. The goal is to support early screening and diagnosis of TB using automated image analysis.
Note: The model is in early stages and still requires more training to improve accuracy and reliability.

The TB Analyzer is designed to:
Detect signs of tuberculosis in chest X-ray images using deep learning.
Classify images as TB Positive or Normal.
This tool can assist in:
Pre-screening in remote or under-resourced areas
Speeding up diagnosis by reducing radiologist workload

We are currently using publicly available TB chest X-ray datasets, including:
Montgomery County X-ray Set
Shenzhen Hospital X-ray Set
Each image is labeled as:
TB Positive
Normal
Note: The dataset is currently limited in size, and more data is needed for reliable predictions.
